% 1. As of early 2018, Usain Bolt holds the world record in the men's

% Sept 16, 2018. Assign his average speed in km/h to the variable
% 'marathon'. The marathon distance is 42.195 km.



% 1. 
hundred = 100e-3 / (9.58/3600)

min_to_hour = 1/60
sec_to_hour = 39/3600

marathon = 42.195 / (2 + min_to_hour + sec_to_hour)
